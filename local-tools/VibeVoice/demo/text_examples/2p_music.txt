Speaker 1: Hey, remember "See You Again"?
Speaker 2: Yeah… from Furious 7, right? That song always hits deep.
Speaker 1: Let me try to sing a part of it for you.
Speaker 1: "It's been a long day… without you, my friend. And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again…"
Speaker 2: Wow… that line. Every time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then this part always makes me think of the people I've lost.
Speaker 1: "We've come a long way… from where we began. Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again…"
Speaker 2: It's beautiful, really. It's not just sad—it's like… hopeful.
Speaker 1: Right? Like no matter how far apart we are, there's still that promise.
Speaker 2: I think that's what made it the perfect farewell for Paul Walker.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And the rap verse? It hits differently too.
Speaker 1: "How can we not talk about family, when family's all that we got?"
Speaker 2: That line's deep. Makes you realize what really matters.
Speaker 1: Exactly. It's more than a song—it's a tribute.
