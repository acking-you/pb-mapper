Speaker 1: Hello everyone, and welcome to the VibeVoice podcast channel. I'm your host, Linda, and today I want to share some very interesting and authentic Chinese expressions with you.

Speaker 1: In Chinese, when you want to say something is super easy, just a simple task, you can use the phrase "小菜一碟". It literally means "a small dish of food", but it means "a piece of cake". For example, if you want to say, "Adding and subtracting three-digit numbers is a piece of cake for me", you can say.

Speaker 1: 三位数的加减法对我来说小菜一碟.

Speaker 1: The next phrase we’re going to learn is “你开玩笑吧”. It's a very common way to express disbelief, like "Are you kidding me?" or "You must be joking". For instance, when you hear an unbelievable piece of news such as your friend brought a T-shirt using 5000 dollars, you can say,

Speaker 1: 你开玩笑吧, 你花五千块钱买了一件衣服.

Speaker 1: Next, let's learn a phrase for when you suddenly understand something, like a "lightbulb moment". In Chinese, you can say "恍然大悟". It means you suddenly "see the light". For example, when you finally grasp a difficult math concept that has confused you for days, you can say.

Speaker 1: 我困惑这个公式好几天了, 但现在我恍然大悟, 终于明白了.

Speaker 1: For our last one, when you want to say something is super easy, you can use a very vivid phrase: "闭着眼睛都能做". It literally means "can do it with one's eyes closed". For example, if you want to say, "He can use this software with his eyes closed", you can say.

Speaker 1: 这个软件他闭着眼都能用."

Speaker 1: Well, that’s all the time we have for today. Thank you for listening. Please subscribe to VibeVoice, where we share all the interesting things in this world with you.
